# Smart Parking System

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a smart parking system that uses IoT sensors and machine learning to optimize urban parking spaces and reduce traffic congestion.

## Problem Statement
With the increasing number of vehicles in urban areas, parking has become a major challenge. The project aims to solve this problem using a smart parking system, powered by real-time data from IoT sensors and predictive models.
